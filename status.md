# Project Status: Comicarr

This file tracks the current features, environment status, and pending/completed tasks for Comicarr (comic book grabber fork).

## Environment Info
- **Language**: Python 3.14.3 (active virtual environment `.venv`)
- **Legacy Codebase Location**: [Mylar.py](file:///E:/Coding Projects/mylar3/.old/Mylar.py)
- **New Stack**: FastAPI + SQLModel (SQLAlchemy & Pydantic) + SQLite + HTMX / Alpine.js (Proposed)

## Current Status
- **Main codebase**: The legacy CherryPy application codebase has been successfully archived to [`.old/`](file:///E:/Coding Projects/mylar3/.old) for reference.
- **Recent changes**:
  - Moved legacy application folders (`mylar/`, `lib/`, `tests/`, etc.) and databases/configs to `.old/`.
  - Kept only virtual environment (`.venv`), rule standard configs, git files, and `status.md` in the root workspace.
  - Generated a comprehensive [README.md](file:///e:/Coding%20Projects/Comicarr/README.md) detailing the origins of Comicarr, highlighting credits/respect to Mylar, and outlining the new FastAPI + HTMX architecture, features, and setup guides.
  - Created a [.dockerignore](file:///e:/Coding%20Projects/Comicarr/.dockerignore) to optimize build context transfer by excluding local cache, virtual envs, and archive folders.
  - Migrated `COMICVINE_API_KEY` configuration from environment variables (`.env`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`) to the dynamic database `SystemSettings` schema, enabling key updates from the UI settings panel without container restarts.
  - Performed a comprehensive settings audit comparing the legacy codebase's settings definitions with the new FastAPI database/cache settings schema, capturing the mapping in a comparison report.
  - Performed a codebase-wide audit and style cleanup, fixing synchronous session querying, metadata sync object iteration errors, and nested lazy imports.
  - Completed a codebase-wide professional standards refactoring:
    - Moved inline HTML strings to template partials in [app/templates/components/](file:///e:/Coding%20Projects/mylar3/app/templates/components/) for status badges and search errors.
    - Implemented a persistent event loop manager in [app/worker.py](file:///e:/Coding%20Projects/mylar3/app/worker.py) to remove asyncio loop recreation overhead in Celery tasks.
    - Set up database migrations with Alembic and updated [app/core/db.py](file:///e:/Coding%20Projects/mylar3/app/core/db.py) to run migrations programmatically on startup.
    - Externalized the weekly pull proxy URL configuration to the dynamic `SystemSettings` schema.
    - Standardized API route form parameter validations using structured dependency injection.
